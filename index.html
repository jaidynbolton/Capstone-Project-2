            <h3>Design and Development</h3>
            <p>From a young age, I've always had a natural attraction to technology. My dad, a software engineer, made his own path through the field, which inspired my growing interest in technology. As I approach the end of my high school career, I feel the need to explore potential career paths, leading me to focus on programming. Currently, I am enrolled in a web development course along with an applied technology class. These courses have increased my understanding of HTML, CSS, VSCode, Autodesk Inventor, 3D printing, Arduino, and much more. While there is still much to learn, I have gained several foundational skills along the way.</p>

            <h3>Certified Cat Lover</h3>
            <p>I really love cats. My family has a total of four cats, three of them being bengals. My cat is named Kix. He's a beautiful 7 year old bengal kitty and I've had him since I was 10. I love him so much. I love all cats and love to meet new ones too!</p>
